This talk will consist of two parts:

* I'll explain what the balena is,
* I'll show you the whole workflow (demo).

If you have any questions, just let me know in advance and I'll try to answer them.

Would like to prepare? You can start learning at [What is balena?](https://www.balena.io/what-is-balena)
