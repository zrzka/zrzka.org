I'm Robert Vojta (also known as 𝒵𝓇𝓏𝓀𝒶). A developer with over two
decades of professional software development experience.

Don't expect a lot of articles on this site. I don't write too much:

* it was already said elsewhere,
* I have nothing to say,
* it takes too much time
to write something meaningful (like
[this post](/aws-journey-api-gateway-lambda-vpc-performance/)
for example) and I'm trying to spend more time with my family.

It doesn't mean that I don't write at all, just the frequency is very low.

# Hiring Information

I'm currently focused on the iOS & macOS development (8+ years of experience) and
the Rust language (2 years of experience).

Be aware that I work remotely only (already working like this for more than 10 years)
and that I'm located in the Czech Republic (Europe). Long term cooperation preferred.

You'd like to ask anything? Interesting project to work on? Would like to hire
me? [Get in touch](mailto:rvojta@me.com). Don't bother if you're a body shop
agency.
