I'm Robert Vojta (also known as 𝒵𝓇𝓏𝓀𝒶). A developer with over two
decades of professional software development experience.

Don't expect a lot of articles on this site. I don't write too much:

* it was already said elsewhere,
* it takes too much time to write something meaningful (like
[this post](/aws-journey-api-gateway-lambda-vpc-performance/) for example).

It doesn't mean that I don't write at all, just the frequency is very low.

## Hiring information

I'm currently focused on the iOS & macOS development (since 2008 - first iOS SDK release) and
the Rust language (since 2018).

Previous experience - C, C++, assembly, Python, AWS, IoT, Linux distribution development, kernel device
drivers, Linux desktop applications, ... 

Be aware that I work remotely only (already working like this for more than 10 years)
and that I'm located in the Czech Republic (Europe). Long term cooperation & EU time zone preferred.

You'd like to ask anything? Interesting project to work on? Would like to hire
me? [Get in touch](mailto:rvojta@me.com).
