I'm Robert Vojta (also known as 𝒵𝓇𝓏𝓀𝒶). A developer with over two
decades of professional software development experience.

Don't expect numerous articles on this site. I don't write too much:

* it was already said elsewhere,
* it takes too much time to write something meaningful (like
[this post](/aws-journey-api-gateway-lambda-vpc-performance/), for example).

It doesn't mean that I don't write at all, just the frequency is very low.

## Hiring information

I'm currently focused on the Ruby & Ruby on Rails development and the Rust language.

Previous experience - Objective-C, Swift, C, C++, assembly, Python, AWS, IoT, Linux distribution development,
kernel device drivers, Linux desktop applications, ... 

Be aware that I work remotely only (already working like this for more than 15 years)
and that I'm located in the Czech Republic (Europe). Long-term cooperation & EU time zone preferred.

You'd like to ask anything? Interesting project to work on? Would like to hire
me? [Get in touch](mailto:rvojta@me.com).
